# 4createTask

### Hi there!
This is a technical task with the following stack:

- [Angular 16](https://v16.angular.io/) 
- [Akita as a state management](https://opensource.salesforce.com/akita/)
- [RxJs](http://rxjs.dev)

This version of Angular was chosen by requirement of using Akita. Unfortunately, Akita doesn't fully support Angular versions higher than 16 (due to `angular.json` config changes). Check [this issue](https://github.com/salesforce/akita/issues/1077) on GitHab for more details.

### Everything you need to start the project

1. Clone / download the project.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
